Notes: When planner link is deployed, the current date is displayed at the top of the screen. Blocks are presented for standard business hours. Time-blocks are color-coded to show whether they are in the past/present/future. when clicking into a time block, entries can be made for specific events. entries can be used by pressing "save"button. when page is refreshed, all evens created remain.
